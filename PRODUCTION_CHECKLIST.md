## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Must Do Before Launch

### 1. Update CORS to Production Domain
**File:** `convex/http.ts`
**Current:** Allows all origins (`*`)
**Action:** Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` array with your production domain(s)

```typescript
const ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
  "https://imzadapp.com",        // Replace with your actual domain
  "https://www.imzadapp.com",
  // Remove localhost entries in production
];
```

**Deploy:** `npx convex deploy`

### 2. Test Rate Limiting
**Status:** Code added but needs testing
**Action:** 
1. Submit 3 waitlist entries with same email
2. Verify 4th attempt returns 429 error
3. Wait 60 minutes or adjust `windowMinutes` for testing

### 3. Set Up Domain and SSL
- [ ] Purchase domain (e.g., imzadapp.com)
- [ ] Configure DNS records
- [ ] Deploy to hosting (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.)
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate is active
- [ ] Update CORS origins in Convex

### 4. Add Analytics
**File:** `analytics.js` (created, needs integration)
**Options:**
- Google Analytics 4
- Plausible Analytics (privacy-friendly)
- Simple Analytics
- Fathom Analytics

**Action:** Choose one and add tracking code to `analytics.js`

### 5. Test All Languages
- [ ] Test English version completely
- [ ] Test French version completely
- [ ] Test Arabic version (RTL layout, text direction)
- [ ] Verify all form validations work in all languages
- [ ] Check legal pages render correctly in all languages

## ðŸŸ¡ HIGH PRIORITY - Recommended Before Launch

### 6. Email Notifications for New Waitlist Signups
**Why:** You need to know when people join
**How:** Add Convex action to send email via Resend, SendGrid, or Mailgun

**Example implementation:**
```typescript
// convex/notifications.ts
import { action } from "./_generated/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export const sendWaitlistNotification = action({
  args: {
    email: v.string(),
    firstName: v.string(),
    userType: v.string()
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Send email to admin
    await fetch("https://api.resend.com/emails", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${process.env.RESEND_API_KEY}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        from: "noreply@imzadapp.com",
        to: "admin@imzadapp.com",
        subject: `New Waitlist Signup: ${args.firstName}`,
        html: `<p>New user joined the waitlist:</p>
               <ul>
                 <li>Name: ${args.firstName}</li>
                 <li>Email: ${args.email}</li>
                 <li>Type: ${args.userType}</li>
               </ul>`
      })
    });
  }
});
```

### 7. Add Confirmation Email to Users
**Why:** Confirms their signup and builds trust
**Action:** Send welcome email after successful waitlist submission

### 8. Set Up Error Monitoring
**Options:**
- Sentry (recommended)
- LogRocket
- Rollbar

**Why:** Catch JavaScript errors in production

### 9. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Compress images (use WebP format)
- [ ] Minify CSS and JavaScript
- [ ] Add lazy loading for images
- [ ] Test page speed with Google PageSpeed Insights
- [ ] Aim for 90+ score on mobile and desktop

### 10. SEO Optimization
- [ ] Add meta description to all pages
- [ ] Add Open Graph tags for social sharing
- [ ] Add Twitter Card tags
- [ ] Create sitemap.xml
- [ ] Add robots.txt
- [ ] Submit to Google Search Console

## ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Nice to Have

### 11. Waitlist Data Export
**Why:** You'll need to contact these users when iOS launches
**Action:** Create Convex query to export waitlist data

```typescript
// convex/waitlist.ts
export const exportAll = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    return await ctx.db.query("waitlist").collect();
  }
});
```

**Usage:**
```bash
npx convex run waitlist:exportAll > waitlist-export.json
```

### 12. Admin Dashboard
**Why:** View waitlist stats without using Convex dashboard
**Features:**
- Total signups
- Signups by user type (shopper/traveler/both)
- Signups by language
- Signups over time (chart)
- Export to CSV

### 13. Referral Tracking
**Why:** Incentivize sharing
**How:** Add referral code parameter to URL
- Track who referred whom
- Offer rewards (e.g., early access, premium features)

### 14. Social Proof
**Why:** Increase conversions
**Options:**
- "Join 1,234 others on the waitlist"
- Recent signups ticker
- Testimonials from beta testers

### 15. A/B Testing
**Test:**
- Different CTA button text
- Modal trigger timing
- Form field order
- Success message copy

**Why:** Reduce friction, increase completion rate
**How:** Break form into 2-3 steps with progress indicator

### 17. Social Login
**Why:** Faster signup
**Options:** Google, Facebook, Apple Sign-In

### 18. SMS Notifications
**Why:** Reach users who prefer SMS
